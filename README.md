Data visualization is commonly used to spur idea generation across teams. They are frequently leveraged during brainstorming or Design Thinking sessions at the start 
of a project by supporting the collection of different perspectives and highlighting the common concerns of the collective. While these visualizations are usually unpolished 
and unrefined, they help set the foundation within the project to ensure that the team is aligned on the problem that theyâ€™re looking to address for key stakeholders.
